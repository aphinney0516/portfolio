## Usage
The navigation bar at the top of the webpage has three links that will take you to about me, work, and contact me, respectively. No matter where you scroll on the page, the header is fixed, so you can use the links to jump elsewhere. When you hover over any of the three work images, they pop out. When you click on them, they will take you to the respective websites. On the footer of the page is my contact information including links to me email, GitHub, and LinkedIn.
